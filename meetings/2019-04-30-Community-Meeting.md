### User stories

* User Name:
  SETUP: distributed Disperse volume 
  GlusterFS - 
  
  ISSUE: User renamed a directory when one of the node, on which some
  bricks were hosted, was rebooted. This lead to a situation where
  directory entries were not visible on mount point even after node was
  up and all the bricks were running.
  
  RECOMMENDATION:
  We are trying to come up with some workaround to get the data back on
  mount point.
  At the same time we have started design discussion to fix this issue in
  gluster code.

### RoundTable
* David S: Gluster documents are not updated. Struggled to set some option
using old document. Information about options are not updated.

* Poornima : We are restructuring documentation of glusterfs. Probably this will be done by glusterfs 7.0.

* David S: What will be the medium of communication in the future? Focus on one platform or fragmented over slack, IRC and mailing list.

* Poornima: Mailing list will always be there. Slack is the platform where we want to go, however, during the transition phase we would continue using IRC.
